  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>
  iPhemap is a comprehensive, regularly updated database that
  aims to provide a field synopsis and catalog all of the in vitro
  neuronal disease phenotypes from induced pluripotent stem
  cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with neurological diseases.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can <a href="search">search cellular and molecular phenotypes </a>
  from <a href="/studies">79 published reports</a>. We characterized 550 distinct
  cellular phenotypes and the resulting relationships between
  gene and phenotype into a phenogenetic map that can be used
  to build new hypotheses in the field of neurological disease
  modeling, and to identify potential new opportunities to
  design novel drug strategies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  iPhemap comprises a comprehensive catalog of phenogenetic profiles from patient
  derived-iPSCs from highly curated, published reports and returns:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
    Cellular phenotypes reporting morphological,
    functional, and process changes from iPSCs, NSCs,
    oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons with
    genetic mutations linked to neurological diseases.
    </li>

    <li>
    Molecular phenotypes, derived from
    microarray analysis and presented as treemaps, 
    describing the associated gene ontology terms.    
    </li>

    <li>
    Dysregulated pathways highlighting disrupted 
    pathways from microarray analysis.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>For details on the background and system biology methods used in iPhemap, see the <a href="research">Methods</a> section. The website is developed and maintained by the <a href="research">Imitola Laboratory</a>.</p>
