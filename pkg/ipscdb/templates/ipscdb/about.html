  <h4>About</h4>
  <p>
  iPhemap is comprehensive regularly updated database that
  aims to provide a field synopsis and catalog all of the in vitro
  neuronal disease phenotypes from induced pluripotent stem
  cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with neurological diseases.
  </p>

  <p>
  You can <a href="search">search cellular and molecular phenotypes </a>
  from <a href="/studies">62 published reports</a>. We characterized 428 distinct
  cellular phenotypes and the resulting relationships between
  gene and phenotype into phenogenetic map that can be used
  to build new hypothese sin the field of neurological disease
  modeling, and to identify potential new opportunities to
  design novel drug strategies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  iPheMap comprises a comprehensive catalog of phenogenetic profiles from patient
  derived-iPSCs from highly curated, published reports and returns:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
    Cellular phenotypes reporting morphological,
    functional, and process changes from iPSCs, NSCs,
    oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons with
    genetic mutations linked to neurological diseases.
    </li>

    <li>
    Molecular phenotypes, which stem from the
    microarray analysis, are derived from the functional
    annotations associated with previously established
    genome ontology. These molecular phenotypes
    are presented as treemaps, sized according to their
    degree of statistical significance.
    </li>

    <li>
    Dysregulated pathways also arising from genome
    ontology, which reflect disrupted canonical
    pathways.
    </li>
  </ol>
